        <p>Panama is a country rich in culture, largely due to the large number of foreigners who choose to live here. As a result, we have many unique customs and beliefs. We are known worldwide as "the country where the Canal is located," connecting North and South America. Not to mention, we boast beautiful beaches on both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.</p>
